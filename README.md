# Resume Screening NLP System
[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Vsriram181/Resume-Screening-With-NLP/blob/main/Resume%20Screening%20with%20NLP%20(TF-IDF)/resume%20Screening%20using%20NLP.ipynb)

A machine learning and NLP-based project that automates the **resume screening** process by matching resumes with job descriptions and ranking them based on similarity.  
This project uses **TF-IDF**, **ML models**, and **BERT embeddings** to evaluate the relevance of resumes for given job descriptions.

## üöÄ Features
- Preprocess resumes and job descriptions using **NLP techniques**.  
- Extract features using **TF-IDF** and **BERT embeddings**.  
- Train multiple machine learning models (**Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting**) for classification.  
- Compare model performance and select the best-performing model.  
- Visualize evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix).  
- Rank resumes based on their relevance to the given job description.

## üìÇ Project Workflow
### Step 1 ‚Äì Data Collection  
Upload datasets:
- `resume_job_matching_dataset.csv` (Resumes + Job Descriptions).  
- Pre-trained BERT embeddings (if using transformer-based models).  

### Step 2 ‚Äì Data Preprocessing  
- Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.  
- Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal).  

### Step 3 ‚Äì Feature Extraction  
- **TF-IDF vectorization** for classical ML models.  
- **BERT embeddings** for semantic understanding.  

### Step 4 ‚Äì Model Training  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- LightGBM  
- Gradient Boosting  

### Step 5 ‚Äì Model Evaluation  
- Compare models using accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall.  
- Select the **best model** for prediction.  

### Step 6 ‚Äì Resume Ranking  
- Predict scores for resumes against a given job description.  
- Rank resumes by predicted relevance.  

### Step 7 ‚Äì Visualization  
- Accuracy comparison graph for all models.  
- Confusion matrix for the best model.  

### Step 8 ‚Äì Final Deployment (Optional)  
- Deploy as a **Streamlit Web App** or on **Hugging Face Spaces**.
